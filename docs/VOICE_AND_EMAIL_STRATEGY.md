# CDMX Art Week: Voice & Email Strategy

## The Voice: Mike's Perspective

### Personal Traits to Channel
- **Fly by the seat of my pants** - spontaneous, not over-planned
- **Flexible** - plans change, roll with it
- **Says yes to everything** - adventurous, open to the unexpected
- **Loves food and experiences** - sensory, visceral, memorable moments
- **Prefers less trafficked, super curated** - anti-hype, finds the real gems

### What This Means for the Writing

**DO:**
- Embrace spontaneity: "I stumbled into this place and..."
- Share genuine discoveries, not PR picks
- Acknowledge that the best moments are often unplanned
- Include food as a central thread (not just art)
- Champion the overlooked: "Everyone's at X, but Y is where it's actually happening"
- Be honest about overhyped events
- Use "I" and personal anecdotes
- Make it feel like a text from a friend who's already there

**DON'T:**
- Create rigid itineraries
- Hype mainstream events everyone already knows
- Sound like a tourism board
- Be comprehensive (curate ruthlessly)
- Use corporate language or hedging
- Pretend everything is amazing

### Voice Examples

**Instead of:** "Zona Maco is the premier art fair in Latin America with over 200 galleries."

**Write:** "Look, Zona Maco is packed and overwhelming. Go Wednesday after 5pm when the crowds thin out, grab a mezcal at the bar in Hall B, and actually enjoy it. Or honestly? Skip the fair and hit the San Miguel Chapultepec gallery walk instead—that's where the real conversations happen."

**Instead of:** "Here are 10 events happening Tuesday."

**Write:** "Tuesday everyone's jet-lagged and cranky. My move: sleep in, get chilaquiles at Eno, then ease into the Kurimanzutto opening around 6pm. The after-party energy is better than trying to do everything."

## Brand Voice Framework

### Primary Voice: "The Insider Friend"
Based on research into The Infatuation, Blackbird Spyplane, and successful culture newsletters.

**Core characteristics:**
- Conversational, "talk-to-me-like-a-friend" tone
- Strong opinions backed by genuine experience
- Enthusiastic but never sycophantic
- Self-aware humor
- Direct address: "Here's what you actually need to know"
- Practical empathy (acknowledges exhaustion, decision fatigue)

### Secondary Influence: "The Irreverent Expert"
From Time Out and Monocle.

**Characteristics:**
- Confident, sometimes provocative takes
- "We know because we go" authority
- Playful with real utility
- Raised-eyebrow humor

### The CDMX Art Week Blend
We're the friend who:
- Lives here (or has been coming for years)
- Knows everyone but isn't pretentious about it
- Will tell you the truth about what's overhyped
- Gets excited about weird, specific things
- Prioritizes experiences over checking boxes
- Always knows where to eat after

## Email Strategy

### Email Types

#### 1. "Today's Move" - Daily during Art Week (Feb 2-9)
**Send time:** 8am local
**Format:**
```
Subject: [Day emoji] [Punchy hook] | Art Week Day X

Hey,

[1-2 sentence vibe check - what's the energy today?]

THE MOVE
[Single top recommendation with 2-3 sentences. This is YOUR pick - where you'd actually go.]

ALSO WORTH IT
• [Event] - [Time] - [One line why]
• [Event] - [Time] - [One line why]

SKIP IT
[One honest "this is overhyped" take - optional but builds trust]

EAT HERE
[One food rec tied to the day's events/neighborhood]

Full schedule: cdmxartweek.com

— Mike
```

#### 2. "Tonight" - Afternoon send for evening events
**Send time:** 4pm local
**Format:**
```
Subject: Tonight: [Hook]

Quick one—

[2-3 party/evening picks with honest context]
[Who's actually going, what the vibe will be]
[Practical: door time, what to wear, how to get in]

See you out there.
```

#### 3. "The Insider" - Pre-week buildup (Jan 27 - Feb 1)
**Purpose:** Build anticipation, provide practical prep
**Topics:**
- Neighborhood primers
- What to book NOW (restaurants, specific events)
- What's overhyped this year
- Hidden gems to watch
- Packing/logistics

#### 4. "The Honest Take" - Deep dive (weekly or post-event)
**Format:** Single topic, longer form
- One exhibition/fair review
- Contrarian take on something everyone's hyping
- Personal story from an unexpected moment

### Subject Line Formula
- Use emoji sparingly but effectively
- Create curiosity or urgency
- Be specific > generic
- Examples:
  - "🌮 Skip Zona Maco, do this instead"
  - "Wednesday's actually the best day. Here's why."
  - "The party everyone's talking about (and whether it's worth it)"
  - "I found the best taco within walking distance of Material"

### Key Principles
1. **One clear recommendation per email** - don't overwhelm
2. **Include one contrarian/honest take** - builds trust
3. **Always tie in food** - it's central to the experience
4. **Acknowledge reader reality** - they're tired, overwhelmed, have FOMO
5. **End with a single call to action** - not multiple asks
