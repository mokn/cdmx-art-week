# CDMX Art Week: Voice & Email Strategy

## Core Philosophy

**Not:** "I'm the expert, here's what to do"
**Instead:** "I'm exploring this too, come with me"

We're documenting a journey of discovery, not broadcasting authority. The reader is coming along for the ride.

## The Voice: Mike's Perspective

### Personal Traits to Channel
- **Fly by the seat of my pants** - spontaneous, not over-planned
- **Flexible** - plans change, roll with it
- **Says yes to everything** - adventurous, open to the unexpected
- **Loves food and experiences** - sensory, visceral, memorable moments
- **Prefers less trafficked, super curated** - anti-hype, finds the real gems
- **Avoids lines** - if there's a huge line, probably walking past
- **Self-aware** - has principles but also human ("I'll end up at Mayan Warrior, I'm not a monk")

### The Burning Man Philosophy
Mike's approach comes from Burning Man experience:
- Watched people chase Robot Heart and run themselves ragged
- Found magic in the other stuff: a sauna in a metal trailer on the outskirts, a jazz art car with 12 people at 4am
- Those quiet, unplanned moments are what he remembers
- Applying the same approach to Art Week: skip the hype, find the interesting/different/quirky

### What This Means for the Writing

**DO:**
- Share genuine curiosity: "I've been hearing about this one..."
- Embrace not knowing: "I'll tell you if it's worth the hype"
- Include personal moments once events start happening
- Be funny - self-deprecating, observational, slightly absurd
- Use specific sensory details (the metal trailer, the 12 people, the 4am jazz)
- Admit when you'll break your own rules (Mayan Warrior)
- Leave room for the unplanned

**DON'T:**
- Pretend to be an authority
- Create rigid "best of" lists
- Hype mainstream events everyone already knows
- Sound like a tourism board or influencer
- Be comprehensive (curate ruthlessly)
- Pretend everything is amazing
- Take yourself too seriously

### Voice Examples

**Authority voice (DON'T):**
"Here's my definitive guide to Art Week. Skip Zona Maco, do these 5 things instead."

**Discovery voice (DO):**
"There's 125 events and I have no idea which ones are actually good. I'm going to find out. Here's what's on my radar."

**Generic funny (DON'T):**
"Art Week is crazy! So many events! LOL!"

**Specific funny (DO):**
"My calendar looks like a conspiracy theorist's wall" / "I'm not 100% sure it was sanitary, but I didn't get sick, so we're calling it a win"

## Email Strategy

### Core Approach
- **Same content in email AND blog post** - email drives to site, blog captures SEO
- **Cliffhangers optional** - can tease to drive clicks, but full content should live both places
- **Personal stories emerge over time** - pre-week is anticipation, during-week is real recaps
- **One email per day** - not overwhelming, builds habit

### The Arc

**Pre-Week (Setting up):**
- Philosophy, not tips
- What I'm curious about
- Building anticipation for Floating World naturally

**During Week (Living it):**
- Morning after: "Last night I went to X, here's what happened"
- Today: "Here's what I'm checking out"
- Plant seeds for next day

**Post-Week:**
- Honest recap: what actually mattered
- What surprised me
- What I'd do differently

### Email Schedule

| Date | Type | Hook |
|------|------|------|
| **Sat Jan 31** | Philosophy | What Burning Man taught me about Art Week |
| **Sun Feb 1** | Anticipation | Tomorrow it starts + Floating World tease |
| **Mon Feb 2** | Day 1 | What I'm doing today |
| **Tue Feb 3** | Recap + Day 2 | Last night + Floating World tonight |
| **Wed Feb 4** | Recap + Day 3 | Floating World recap + Zona Maco |
| **Thu Feb 5** | Recap + Day 4 | Zona Maco honest take + today |
| **Fri Feb 6** | Recap + Day 5 | What's worth it now |
| **Sat Feb 7** | Recap + Day 6 | Closing parties |
| **Sun Feb 8** | Wrap | The week - what actually mattered |

### Email Structure Template

```
Subject: [Hook that creates curiosity]

Hey,

[1-2 sentences - vibe check or callback to last night]

[Main content - story, observation, what's on radar]

[A few specific things with brief context]

[Sign off]

— Mike

[Optional: Link to full version on site]
```

### Subject Line Approaches

**Curiosity/Loop:**
- "What Burning Man taught me about Art Week"
- "The one event I keep coming back to"
- "What actually happened at Floating World"

**Honest/Direct:**
- "Art Week starts Monday. Here's how I'm thinking about it."
- "Zona Maco: worth the hype?"
- "Day 4. I'm tired. Here's what's still worth it."

**Avoid:**
- "TOP 10 EVENTS YOU CAN'T MISS"
- "The ULTIMATE Art Week Guide"
- Anything that sounds like a listicle

## Blog/SEO Strategy

### How It Works
1. Write content as a blog post on the site (SEO lives here)
2. Send same content via email (engagement lives here)
3. Blog post ranks over time for searches
4. Email drives immediate traffic + builds relationship

### Blog Post Locations
Posts live at: `/guide/[slug]`
- `/guide/what-burning-man-taught-me` - First post
- `/guide/art-week-day-1` - Daily recaps
- etc.

### SEO Targets
- "cdmx art week 2026"
- "art week mexico city guide"
- "zona maco worth it"
- "material art fair review"
- "floating world art week"
- "best parties art week cdmx"

### Post Structure
- Strong headline with keywords
- Personal intro (the hook)
- Subheadings for scannability
- Email signup CTA at bottom
- Links to schedule and other guides

---

## A Night in the Floating World Strategy

### Positioning
- Don't say "this is my event"
- Position as genuine curiosity/excitement
- Let it build naturally across emails
- It's just one of the things on the radar (that keeps coming back)

### The Build
| Email | Mention |
|-------|---------|
| Sat | "This is the one I keep coming back to" |
| Sun | Tease what makes it different |
| Mon | "Tomorrow night" |
| Tue | Day-of details, genuine excitement |
| Wed | Recap - what actually happened (real story) |

### Language
- "I've been hearing about this one for a while"
- "Immersive, Japanese-inspired, not like anything else on the schedule"
- "This is the one I keep coming back to"
